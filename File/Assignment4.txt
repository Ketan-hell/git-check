i used java collection class to sort the given arraylist as th collection is present in java collection framework.
java.util.Collections;

First get input from user for the expense to be search using Scanner class;
now applying for loop to search that element in the list;
using if condition to see if the expense is present in the arraylist
if arrayList.contains expenses
it will print that expense is present and the index;
